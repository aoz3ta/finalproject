    <h1>Robot Awakening</h1>
    <h2>By Dylan Ayala</h2>
    <p> This small animation is about a robot that has awakened thousands of years after humanity has left Earth in search of a new planet. I thought about making this because I enjoy doing sci-fi animations, and I was inspired by an animation I saw a few days ago.</p>
